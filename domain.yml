      Great! Let me find someone for you to chitchat with.
       
      I will get back to you soon... ⏳

      I can arrange video chitchat with another human for you 🎥 🗣 ☎️
       
      Here is how it works:
       
      - I find someone who also wants to chitchat.
      - I confirm with you and them that you are both ready.
      - I send both of you a video chat link.

      Unfortunately, I couldn't find anyone 😞
       
      I will try to get back to you when someone shows up...
       
      P. S. Do you have a photo in your Telegram profile? Having a photo increases chances that someone responds.

      Ok, declined ❌
       
      May I ask you if there is any specific time or times of day (maybe days of week) when you are more likely to join someone for chitchat over a video call?
  utter_hope_to_see_you_later:
  - text: |-
      Ok, I will not bother you 🛑
       
      Should you decide that you want to chitchat with someone, just let me know - I will set up a video call 🙂
       
      See ya! 😉
