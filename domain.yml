      Hi, my name is Swipy🙃
       
      Do you feel lonely or isolated? 👾
       
      Or maybe you just want to talk to a new person?👩‍💼
       
      I can arrange video chitchat with another human for you 😉
  utter_sad_offer_chitchat:
  - text: |-
      I am sorry that you're feeling down 😞
       
      Do you want me to put you on a video call with someone?
       
      This may or may not help but is still worth a try.

      I'm sorry, I cannot help you with that.
       
      I can arrange video chitchat with another human for you, however.
       
      Do you want me to do that?

      Great! Let me find someone for you to chitchat with.
       
      I will get back to you soon... ⏳

      Got it!
       
      And would it be ok if I got back to you when someone else wanted to chitchat?
  utter_thanks_for_being_ok_to_chitchat:
  - text: |-
      Thank you, I appreciate this!
       
      I will get back to you when someone else asks for chitchat.

  utter_how_it_works:
  - text: |-
      I can arrange video chitchat with another human for you.
      Here is how it works:
       
      - I find someone who also wants to chitchat.
      - I confirm with you and them that you are both ready.
      - I send both of you a video chat link.

  - text: |-
      Hooray! I found someone who wants to have a video chat! 🎥 ☎️
       
      Are you ready?
  utter_no_one_was_found:
  - text: |-
      Unfortunately, I couldn't find anyone 😞
       
      I will try to get back to you when someone shows up...

  - text: |-
      Hey! Someone is asking me to arrange chitchat.
       
      Would you be willing to jump into a video call? 🎥 ☎️
  utter_checking_if_partner_ready_too:
  - text: |-
      Just a moment, I'm checking if that person is ready too...
       
      Please don't go anywhere - this may take up to two minutes ⏳
  utter_check_if_ready:
  - text: Are you ready for the call? 🎥 ☎️
  utter_partner_already_gone:
  - text: |-
      That person has become unavailable 😞
       
      Not all is lost, however!
       
      Do you want me to look for someone else? 🙂

      Ok, I will let that person go then 😞
       
      Do you want me to stop bothering you for awhile?

      Ok, I will not bother you.
       
      Should you decide that you want to chitchat with someone, just let me know - I'll be here to arrange a video call.
