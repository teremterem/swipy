        Hi, my name is SwipyðŸ™ƒ


        Do you feel lonely or isolated?
        Or maybe you just want to talk to a new person?


        I can arrange a video chitchat with another human for you.

        Do you want to have a video chitchat with another human?
        If you're feeling down that may or may not cheer you up. It is still worth a try, though.
        Do you want me to arrange it for you?

        I'm sorry, I cannot help you with that.


        I can arrange a video chitchat with another human for you, however.
        Do you want me to do that for you?

        Great! Let me find someone for you to chitchat with.


        I will get back to you soon.

        Ok, and if someone else felt lonely and wanted a video chitchat, would it be ok if I pinged you then?

        - I find someone who also wants to chitchat.
        - I confirm with you and them that you are both ready.
        - I send both of you a video chat link.
