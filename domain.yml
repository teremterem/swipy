      Hi, my name is Swipy🙃


      Do you feel lonely or isolated?
      Or maybe you just want to talk to a new person?


      I can arrange a video chitchat with another human for you.

      Do you want to have a video chitchat with another human?
      If you're feeling down that may or may not cheer you up. It is still worth a try, though.
      Do you want me to arrange it for you?

      I'm sorry, I cannot help you with that.


      I can arrange a video chitchat with another human for you, however.
      Do you want me to do that for you?

      Great! Let me find someone for you to chitchat with.


      I will get back to you soon.

      I can arrange a video chitchat with another human for you.
      Here is how it works:

      - I find someone who also wants to chitchat.
      - I confirm with you and them that you are both ready.
      - I send both of you a video chat link.

      Hooray! I found someone who wants to have a video chat!


      Are you ready?

      Ok, I will let that person go then😞


      Do you want me to stop bothering you for awhile?

      Ok, I will not bother you.


      If you change your mind, however, and decide that you want to have a chitchat with someone just let me know. I'll be here.
      Hope to see you later. Bye!
